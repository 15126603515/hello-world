Good eveningÔºÅ Mr Li

The news:
On November 3rd, the League of Legends S8 Finals finally started. The iG team from the LPL team played against the FNC team from the European Division. Both sides defeated the opponent 3-0 in the semi-final. What we see is a strong dialogue. The middle and upper state of the two sides are bursting, and it is also a perfect match for this medium-upper version.
